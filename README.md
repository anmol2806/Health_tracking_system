# Health_tracking_system

Health monitoring is the major problem in todayâ€™s world. Due to lack of proper health monitoring
and checkups, patients suffer from serious health issues. There are lots of devices nowadays to
monitor the health of patients over the internet. Health experts are also taking advantage of these

smart devices to keep a record on their patients. With tons of new healthcare technology start-
ups, IoT is rapidly revolutionizing the healthcare industry.

Here in this project, a Health Status Tracking System has been developed in which the sensors
record the patient heart beat rate and body temperature time to time and send an email/SMS alert only
when those readings go beyond critical values. Pulse rate and body temperature readings are recorded
over the cloud platforms of Thing Speak and Google sheets so that patient health can be monitored
from anywhere over the internet. A panic button is also be attached so that patients or nurses can
press it during an emergency situation to send email/SMS to the doctors, management and relatives.
System Requirements:

1. Arduino Uno and Programming Cable
2. ESP8266 Wi-Fi module
3. LM35 temperature sensor
4. Pulse rate sensor
5. Push button
6. 10k Resistor
7. Male-female wires
8. Breadboard
